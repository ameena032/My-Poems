                        Desire to garner the lofty destiny.<br>
                        I have seen God in my parents,<br>
                        What made me so to tell this?<br>
                        <br>
                        Arms of perpetual love, my mother<br>
                        The purest love, my mother's eyes.<br>
                        She holds my hand for a while but heart forever<br>
                        Her love flows like a gentle flower.<br>
                        <br>
                        The greatest gift by God, my father<br>

                        But is that just and what it actually hurls?<br>
                        <br>
                        Girls are beautiful as butterflies,<br>
                        With joy of colors in them.<br>
                        Written on media and heard people believing them.<br>

                        <br>
                        Is the girl as independent as the butterfly?<br>
                        Is she allowed to fly away like one?<br>
                        Does she have the permission to soar the sky so high<br>
                        like one?<br>
                        <br>
                        No! Then why this comparison?<br>
                        Even if forsaken,<br>
                        Then why don’t we let her be the butterfly of our<br>
                        society?<br>
                        <br>
                        Let a girl be independent,<br>
                        Let her fly high,<br>
                        Let her get rid of any sigh and attain her goal with her<br>
                        kind of joy.

                        Like ups and downs in every flight.<br>
                        And hope I like this way<br>

                        In the depths of my mind, memories reside,<br>
                        A tapestry of moments, forever tied.<br>
                        They dance and they shimmer, like stars in the night,<br>
                        Guiding my spirit, with their radiant light.<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh, the memories I hold, like treasures untold,<br>
                        Each one a story, waiting to unfold.<br>
                        The laughter and joy, the tears and the pain,<br>
                        They all weave together, in a beautiful refrain.<br>
                        <br>
                        I reminisce on the days gone by,<br>
                        When innocence and wonder filled the sky.<br>
                        Childhood adventures, so simple and sweet,<br>
                        Oh, how I yearn for those memories to repeat.<br>
                        <br>
                        The flavors of summer, on a sun-kissed tongue,<br>
                        The warmth of family, love forever strung.<br>
                        Breezes whispered secrets, as we chased dreams,<br>
                        Those memories remain, like glowing sunbeams.<br>
                        <br>
                        The nostalgic scent of a familiar place,<br>
                        Transporting me back, to a familiar embrace.<br>
                        Friends long gone, like passing ships at sea,<br>
                        But their memory lingers, forever with me.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first love's embrace, an electrifying touch,<br>
                        Oh, the memories of young love, they mean so much.<br>
                        We danced together, in a passionate rhyme,<br>
                        Creating a melody, that stood the test of time.<br>
                        <br>
                        As seasons changed, and years rolled on,<br>
                        The memories expanded, like a rolling dawn.<br>
                        Some faded like whispers, in a distant haze,<br>
                        While others, like ripples, in my heart, still blaze.<br>
                        <br>
                        In the kaleidoscope of my mind they dwell,<br>
                        Those memories, like magic, casting their spell.<br>
                        They shape who I am, and who I'm meant to be,<br>
                        For memories in mind, unlock the soul's key.
